//? Introduction To Types in Typescript

//* In Typescript, Type Annotation is a way of explicitly specifying the type of a variable, function parameter, or function return value.

//! AdvantagesðŸ“Œ
//? It helps the typescript compiler to enforce type checking and provide type safety during development.
//? What operations could we performed on that variable or value.

//? Type annotations are expressed by using a colon(:) followed by the desired type after the variable or function parameter declaration. There can be space after the colon.

let num1: number = 10;
let str1: string = "Hello";

//* num1 = "kirtti";
console.log(num1.toString());

//* Number Type ðŸ“Œ

//? The number type represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

//TODO Arithimatic Operations:
//? Number types in Typescript support arithimatic operations such as (+,-,*,/) and the results of these operations are also numbers.
