let num1: number = 10;
let str1: string = "Hello";

//! AdvantagesðŸ“Œ
//? It helps the typescript compiler to enforce type checking and provide type safety during development.
//? What operations could we performed on that variable or value.

//? Type annotations are expressed by using a colon(:) followed by the desired type after the variable or function parameter declaration. There can be space after the colon.
