//? Introduction To Types in Typescript
//* In Typescript, Type Annotation is a way of explicitly specifying the type of a variable, function parameter, or function return value.
//! Advantages📌
//? It helps the typescript compiler to enforce type checking and provide type safety during development.
//? What operations could we performed on that variable or value.
//? Type annotations are expressed by using a colon(:) followed by the desired type after the variable or function parameter declaration. There can be space after the colon.
var num1 = 10;
var str1 = "Hello";
//* num1 = "kirtti";
console.log(num1.toString());
